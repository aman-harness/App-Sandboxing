Application-Sandboxer
---------------------

This is a simple SandBoxing Application developed using POSIX API's for running any binary file safely.

Build Instructions:- 

The file uses some commands of c++11. So use ths flag -std=c++11 while compiling.<br />
Comilation Command:- `g++ final_v.cpp -w -std=c++11`

Using
-----

Run the .out file generated by compiling the final_v.cpp file with the following flags:-

-t or --time ## - sets the max time limit of the Black-Box Process<br />
-m or --memory ## - sets the maximum memory that can be consumed by the Black-Box process. <br />
-f or --frquency ## - sets the frequency of polling the resources being used by the process.<br />
-d or --debug - set the debug flag(You will see the result of each Poll with the frequency you set.)<br />
Replace ## with your preferred values.

Memory limits are in KB, Time limits are in Clock Ticks, and frequency is in seconds.

Running:-
eg. if you want to run firefox with time clocks - 1000, memory 1000000 KB's and frequency 0.5 s
run - <br />
`./a.out -t 1000 -m 10000000 -f 0.1 -d firefox`

NOTE:- If you want to restrict the Black-Box from using Network, Add unshare -n before the command as:-<br />

`unshare -n ./a.out -t 1000 -m 10000000 -f 0.1 -d firefox`
